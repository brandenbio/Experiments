   	<p>Thanks for completing our study!</p>

    <p>Our study was designed to examine how people understand words such as "know" and "believe" when they're used in everyday language. 
	People often use those words to describe what's inside other people's heads: "John knows that it's raining" says something about some 
	piece of information that John is aware of. Philosophers are interested in words such as "know" and "believe" because they might provide clues about
	the real world. After all, the sentence, "John knows that it's raining" suggests that it is, indeed, raining. </p>

    <p>Our goal in this study was to understand how people process words such as "know" and "believe", and whether that affects the assumptions
	and inferences they make about the real world. To date, language scientists do not have a theory about how these words are processed -- 
	even though they're used frequently in daily speech! We hope to fill in that gap. </p>
